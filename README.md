# 01 Horiseon Marketing Page Refactoring

## Description

The motivation for this project was to refactor the Horiseon marketing site to adhere to accessibility standards and to optimize it for search engines. To do this I completed the following: I replaced unspecific HTML elements with semantic HTML elements; structured the HTML in a logical and coherent order; added alt attributes to all images and icons; ordered all heading attributes into sequential order; condensed and cleaned up the CSS; and added descriptive comments for all of the CSS selectors. Completing this project taught me a lot about what certain CSS properties and values achieve, and taught me how to intelligently and efficiently organize a HTML page using semantic elements.
